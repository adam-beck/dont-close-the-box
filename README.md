# Shut the Box


### Overview

Shut the Box, also called Canoga, Klackers, Batten Down the Hatches, kingoball and Jackpot, is a game of dice for one or
more players, commonly played in a group of two to four for stakes. Traditionally, a counting box is used with tiles
numbered 1 to 9 where each can be covered with a hinged or sliding mechanism, though the game can be played with only a
pair of dice, pen, and paper. Variations exist where the box has up to 10 or 12 tiles.
